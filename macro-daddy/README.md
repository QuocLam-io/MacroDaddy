## Code Example

Here is a snippet of my button code that initializes the divs to have the hidden word appear in the center as boxes and the music to start.

//! ------------------------------ TDEE Equation ----------------------------- */
  useEffect(() => {
    if (userStats.gender === "female") {
      setBmr(
        Math.round(
          (655 +
            4.35 * userStats.weight +
            4.7 * userStats.height -
            4.7 * userStats.age) *
            userStats.physical
        )
      );
    } else {
      setBmr(
        Math.round(
          (66 +
            6.23 * userStats.weight +
            12.7 * userStats.height -
            6.8 * userStats.age) *
            userStats.physical
        )
      );
    }
  }, []);
